#ABOUT PROJECT
#comment-sections
This is basically a project which was to be a part of a larger project 'Kodecamp blog'
This involves a 90% work with javascript on the comment section of the site kodecamp blog.

With the use of mainly javscript, I was able to create a functionality on the comment project where individuals are able to make new comments, reply on existing comments,
hide both new and existing comments and reply on replies of existing comments.

This task was part of my drive to learn new functions and elements on javscript, build my knowledge and experience on functional websites, and continue my journey to the path of 
becoming an expert in javascript programming language and also becoming a professional website developer.

You are free to clone and text run the functionalities of the site. You could contribute to making the comment section much better than it is currently. 
There are definitely bugs to fix and few left out functionality, but as I improve in my knowledge, I will get the comment project to full perfection.

That is basically what this project is about.


#PROJECT BUILDING PROCESSES
With my knowledge on html and CSS and css libraries such as bootstrap which was used for building this project, I was able to make this project look presentable even on the webpage.
Creating a new comment was done with javascript. where each comment is added to an array of objects of comments. When a user creates a new comment, his name value, and comment values are added to the 
array of comments using a push method on javascript.

Clicking the "replies" button on each comments enables a secondary form where repliers can input their names and replies and adding the replies on the particular comment.

The "Hide and Show button" below each comment is used to hide the particular comment and show hidden comments in the comment section. This function was done by using a javscript methode called "Toggle" to switch the class name of the particular comment to a class with a styling of "Display=none".
With that, the commments are displayed and hidden when the hide amd show buttons are clicked severally.


#Finally
I was glad to assist my team mates on the kodecamp blog site which I am also working on as a collaborator and contributor to the success of the project.You can check out the full kodecamp bloge site on my  git repositories.

Thank you.
